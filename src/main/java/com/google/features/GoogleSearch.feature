Feature: Google search
  As Barclays employee
  I want to search for Barclays keyword on google search
  So That https://www.barclays.co.uk/ is the first result on results page

  Scenario: Search for Barclays on google.com
    Given I have "chrome" browser opened
    When I go to "https://www.google.com/"
    And I type "Barclays" into search bar
    And I hit search
    Then "https://www.barclays.co.uk" is first url on search results page
